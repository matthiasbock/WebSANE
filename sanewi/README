 WHAT IS IT?
 -----------
 SANE Web Interface (SWI) is a Web "portal" system for accessing the SANE
 scanner connected to a Linux host by means of a standard Web browser.
 
 SWI is built upon set of server side PHP and shell scripts, client 
 side JavaScript, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) also including some
 JavaScript.
 
 At the moment (July 2003) the only SVG viewer working satisfactory as a 
 browser plugin is Adobe's SVG viewer. It works fine only for MS Windows
 Internet Explorer. Other platforms or browsers do not seem to have this 
 issue solved. Yet. SVG is rather new technology.
 
 So you will be limited to using MS Internet Explorer for a while.
 
 I wrote SWI for my own use, so it is relatively straightforward and simple.
 Still I believe at the moment it is already ready for general use. There 
 are peopole using it in real production environment and they do not
 complain. I like it too. :)
 
 SWI in its present form does not provide for user identification and privacy.
 All scans at the server are available to anyone who has network access to the
 server. While in most cases this is not a problem, please be aware of it.
 
 You may access help on portal interface when you run SWI or you may just
 study file help.html prior to running SWI.
 
 This version of SWI is designated as beta just in order to give a time gap 
 for bugs to show up, if they are there, before SWI is declared final.
 
 
 LICENSING
 ---------
 SANE Web Interface is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
 See file COPYING for details.
 
 
 SETTING UP
 ----------
 Your server must have installed Apache with PHP module, ImageMagic, and of 
 course, SANE itself.
 
 Please study SANE man pages for setting up and configuring it.
 
 Unpack the archive into directory of your preference. My Linux system is
 SuSE 8.0 and I have placed the files into the "scanner" directory located in
 "/usr/local/httpd/htdocs". If you also run SuSE, you can do the same, it will
 save some typing.
 
 Then:
 
 1.)
 Edit few parameters in file "scanner.cfg" to match your system. I have marked
 them so that it is easier to find. Of course, you are not limited to anything,
 you can change whatever you want if you are up to it.
 
 2.)
 Edit script file "clear.sh" and change the name of the spool directory to
 match the one in "scanner.cfg".

 See if file ownerships and permissions fit your needs.
  
 That should be all (unless I have forgot something)!

 When you use SWI for a first time, the preview pane will not show up until
 you acquire the first preview image.
 

 BUGS
 ----
 None known at the moment.
 
 SWI was successfully tested with HP ScanJet 6100C and ScanJet 5100C. 
 
 
 FEEDBACK
 --------
 I would appreciate you telling me if you use this software, did you
 like it or not and what ideas do you have for future improvements.
 
 Of course, please let me know, if you find any more bugs!
 
 If SWI does not work for you or if you have any questions, please study
 information available on the Internet first. If it does not help, you may
 contact me directly, but I do not promise to help or even answer, because I
 may be busy with other things. My primary education is in Civil Engineering,
 not the Programming, so if I found all the answers on the Net, so can you. :)
 
 As the development of this program is not my main business, its future very
 much rests with you. Even if you have some very small input, please send it
 to me and it may get incorporated into the next updated version of SWI.
 

 Happy scanning!
 
 Best regards!
