 IDEAS FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
 -----------------------------
 * let user edit all the parameters in one place (integrate "clear.sh" like 
   the other scripts)!
 * do we need explicit declaration of base URL in config?
 * does anyone know a way to run programs directly from PHP avoiding shell
   wrappers?
 * automatic setup, RPM?
 * cookies to remember the user settings between sessions?
 * user identification and their data separation for privacy?
 * possibly introduce use of MySQL?
 * scans by email - images arriving directly to your mailbox (would anyone
   need this?)?
 * "copy" option - "scanner-to-printer" function?
